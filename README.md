This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install all dependencies:

npm install
```

> **Before this next step, ensure that you have a `.env` file in the project root.**
Then, generate the Prisma Client:

npx prisma generate
```

Finally, anytime you want to interact with the project locally, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
